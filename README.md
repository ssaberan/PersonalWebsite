## Usage

```bash
npm i
```

Build the files for production (not required for running the dev server)

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the dev server

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the website

or start the production server

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to see the website

Note: If you want to run the website on an external device on the same network, add `-- --host` to either of the start scripts and then hit the url given to you once the script runs.

## Favicon Meaning

![](/images/favicon.ico)

My initials are S.S. and my birthday is 8/8, so my favicon is meant to look like an S and an 8 simultaneously. I am not an artist so I just looked through fonts until I found one that had its S look like an 8.
