# Soroush's Personal Website

Portfolio of Soroush's blog posts, projects, and resume, as well as a contact form for getting in touch with him. Currently live at https://ssaberan.github.io/

## Usage

Install any necessary dependecnies (only needs to be done if node_modules are not already installed)

```bash
npm i
```

Build the files for production (not required for running the dev server)

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the dev server (supports hot reloading, but is not completely accurate to how it will behave in production)

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the website

or start the production server (does not support hot reloading, but behaves much closer to the real thing)

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to see the website

Note: If you want to run the website on an external device on the same network, add `-- --host` to either of the start scripts and then hit the url given to you once the script runs.

## Favicon Meaning

![](/images/favicon.ico)

My initials are S.S. and my birthday is 8/8, so my favicon is meant to look like an S and an 8 simultaneously. I am not an artist so I just looked through fonts until I found one that had its S look like an 8.

## Mathematical Notation

All mathematical notation used in blog posts come from here: https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php

## Images

All images except for the favicon are taken from `https://pixabay.com/` and `https://undraw.co/`
